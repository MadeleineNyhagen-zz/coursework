### Start counter at 0
##counter = 0
##
### While 'counter' is less than or equal to 5, run the loop
##
##while counter < 5:
##    # Show counter value
##    print counter
##    # the long way to increase counter by 1
##    # counter = counter + 1
##    # shortcut to increase counter by 1
##    counter += 1
##print counter

# Run loop in range 0 - 5
# Counter changes automatically in each iteration
for counter in range(0,5):
    # Show the value of counter
    print counter

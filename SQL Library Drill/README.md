These are scripts created using Microsoft SQL Server in response to an assignment I was given at The Tech Academy. The files are numbered in order of implementation; The SQLibraryDrill1CrTbl file creates a database called dbLibrary and then creates tables within the database. SQLibraryDrill2 populates those tables. SQLLibraryDrill3Queries contains queries for those tables, as well as creating and running a stored procedure.
